    <meta name="description" content="Cookie Clicker is a fun and addictive idle clicker game developed by Julien ‘Orteil’ Thiennot. It involves clicking on a large cookie to earn cookies, which can then be used to purchase various upgrades and assets like cursors, grandmas, and factories that automatically produce more cookies over time. As you progress, you’ll unlock a wide range of features that add depth to the game. These include Golden Cookies that provide temporary boosts, a prestige system that allows you to reset your progress in exchange for permanent bonuses, and various achievements to pursue.">
